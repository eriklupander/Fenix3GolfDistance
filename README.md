# Fenix3GolfDistance
App for Garmin Fenix 3 for showing golf distance and hole info.

Only contains one single 18-hole course (Sotenäs GK, Gul/Röd) right now which I've hardcoded into the app based on manual plotting of green positions on Google Maps.

Will hopefully build a backend application to let users plot their own favourite course(s) and download them onto their watches.

App should work on more Garmin models than just Fenix 3.
